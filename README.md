# Archlinux dotfiles

This is the backup of my Archlinux config files and packages.
Powered by https://www.chezmoi.io

If someone read this i guess the cool things to check out
are my little dwmbar scripts, maybe my firefox configs,
but overall, i suggest you don't waste your time. 

This repo has not really been made to be used by peoples other than me.
Yeah pretty much just basic dotfiles here, i guess.

### Installation

```bash
  sudo pacman -S chezmoi
  chezmoi init https://github.com/remi-maurice/dotfiles.git
