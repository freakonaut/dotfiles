This searXng addon needs to be manually installed in the "Debug Add-ons" section of firefox, i had to use this solution because i could not add searX manually because of an xml error. 

To change the preffered searXng instance just edit the manifest.json file.

You can find them at (https://searx.space/)

This is forked from (https://github.com/Erghel/SearXNG-Web-Extension)
