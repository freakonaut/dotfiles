# SearX Garuda Firefox addon

I had to go this route to use Searx as my default search engine because of stupid xml addon errors.

To change the preffered searXng instance just edit the manifest.json file, you can find them at (https://searx.space/)

I have included my mozilla signed unlisted .xpi addon in here for easier install. 

#### Forked from 

https://github.com/Erghel/SearXNG-Web-Extension

#### Why unlisted?

This is my first addon, i tough the review process would be faster. And theres already a ton of these.
